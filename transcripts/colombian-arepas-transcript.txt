Colombian Arepas Recipe - Full Transcript

[00:00 - Introduction]
Hello everyone, and welcome back to Chef Jonathan Buitrago's channel! Today, we're diving into one of Colombia's most beloved staples: the Arepa. If you've never had an authentic Colombian arepa, you're in for a treat. These golden, crispy corn pockets are versatile, delicious, and a cornerstone of our cuisine. Let's get started!

[00:20 - Ingredients Overview]
For this basic arepa recipe, you'll need just a few simple ingredients that you can find at most grocery stores or Latin markets:
- 2 cups of precooked white cornmeal (masarepa – make sure it's precooked!)
- 2 cups of warm water
- 1 teaspoon of salt
- A bit of butter or oil for cooking

That's it! No yeast, no flour – just pure corn goodness.

[00:45 - Preparing the Dough]
Start by pouring the warm water into a large bowl. Add the salt and stir until it dissolves. Now, gradually add the masarepa while mixing with your hands. The key here is to incorporate the cornmeal slowly to avoid lumps. Knead the mixture for about 3-5 minutes until it forms a soft, smooth dough that doesn't stick to your hands. If it's too dry, add a splash more water; if too sticky, a bit more cornmeal.

[01:30 - Shaping the Arepas]
Once your dough is ready, take a golf ball-sized portion and roll it into a smooth ball. Then, gently flatten it between your palms to about 1/2 inch thick and 3-4 inches in diameter. Aim for even thickness so they cook uniformly. Pro tip: If the dough cracks on the edges, just wet your hands a little – it helps!

[02:15 - Cooking the Arepas]
Heat a non-stick skillet or comal over medium heat and add a teaspoon of butter or oil. Place your shaped arepas in the pan – don't overcrowd them! Cook for about 5-7 minutes on each side, or until they're golden brown and crispy on the outside. You'll hear a nice sizzle, and they should puff up slightly. Patience is key; don't rush the browning.

[03:40 - Serving Suggestions]
Fresh off the pan, these arepas are perfect plain, but elevate them! Fill with cheese for arepas de queso, or go savory with shredded beef, avocado, and eggs for a reina pepiada. In Colombia, we eat them for breakfast, lunch, dinner – anytime!

[04:20 - Tips and Variations]
- Always use precooked masarepa; regular cornmeal won't work the same.
- For sweeter arepas, add a bit of sugar to the dough.
- Store leftovers in an airtight container and reheat in a skillet or toaster oven to crisp them up.
