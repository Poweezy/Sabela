# TODO: Integrate Live Social Media Feeds

## Overview
This TODO tracks the implementation of live social media feeds (Twitter timeline and Facebook page plugin) in a new "Latest Updates" section after the Resources section. This enhances social integration by showing real-time updates from the organization's social channels.

## Steps

- [ ] Step 1: Add the "Latest Updates" section HTML in index.html after the Resources section, including embed placeholders for Twitter and Facebook.
- [ ] Step 2: Include the necessary scripts for Twitter (X) and Facebook embeds in the head or before closing body tag in index.html.
- [ ] Step 3: Add CSS styles for the new section in style.css, ensuring responsive grid layout, consistent with site design, and lazy loading if possible.
- [ ] Step 4: Mark the task as [x] in TODO-enhancements.md under Social Integration.
- [ ] Step 5: Test the implementation - Use browser_action to launch the site, verify embeds load correctly, check responsiveness on mobile/desktop, ensure no performance issues.

## Completion Notes
- Use official embed codes: For Twitter, use the timeline widget; for Facebook, use the page plugin.
- Assume placeholder social handles: @TheClimateWatch (Twitter), facebook.com/TheClimateWatch (Facebook) - update if actual handles provided.
- Ensure embeds are accessible (ARIA labels) and privacy-compliant (no tracking without consent).
- After all steps, use attempt_completion to finalize.
