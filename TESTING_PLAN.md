# Testing Plan for Color Palette Changes in style.css

## Objective
To thoroughly test the updated primary color (#059669) applied in style.css across the entire web application to ensure visual consistency, accessibility, and usability.

## Scope
- All pages and sections of the website
- All interactive UI elements including buttons, links, forms, icons, and focus states
- Accessibility compliance including keyboard navigation and WCAG contrast ratios

## Testing Steps

### 1. Visual Inspection
- Navigate through every page and section of the website.
- Verify the primary color (#059669) is applied consistently on:
  - Buttons (primary, secondary, ghost)
  - Links and hover states
  - Icons and interactive elements
  - Focus and active states for keyboard navigation

### 2. Accessibility Testing
- Use keyboard navigation (Tab, Shift+Tab) to move through interactive elements.
- Confirm focus outlines and indicators are visible and use the primary color where applicable.
- Use accessibility tools (e.g., Lighthouse, axe) to check color contrast ratios meet WCAG AA or AAA standards.

### 3. Functional Testing
- Interact with all buttons, links, forms, and other UI controls to ensure no visual or functional regressions.
- Confirm that tooltips, modals, dropdowns, and other dynamic elements display correctly with the updated color palette.

### 4. Cross-Browser and Device Testing
- Test the site on multiple browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Test on different device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile) to ensure color consistency and usability.

## Reporting
- Document any inconsistencies, accessibility issues, or regressions found.
- Provide screenshots and detailed descriptions for any issues.
- Suggest fixes or improvements if necessary.

## Tools Recommended
- Browser Developer Tools for CSS inspection
- Accessibility testing tools (Lighthouse, axe, WAVE)
- Cross-browser testing platforms (BrowserStack, Sauce Labs)
