# Accessibility Improvements Plan

## Steps to Complete

### 1. Edit index.html for tabindex and aria-labels
- [x] Add tabindex="0" to all interactive buttons (e.g., mobileMenuBtn, weather-filter buttons, map-control-btns, uploadBtn, share-btns, filter-btns, form buttons).
- [x] Enhance aria-labels for icon-only buttons (e.g., weather filters: "Filter by all regions", map controls: "Zoom in map").

### 2. Testing
- [x] Launch browser and test tab navigation: Tab through elements to verify logical focus order on buttons and links.
- [x] Check headings hierarchy with keyboard navigation or console logs.
- [x] Verify no errors in console and proper aria-label announcements.

### 3. Finalization
- [ ] Update TODO.md with completion status.
- [ ] If issues found, iterate on edits.

## Progress
- User approved plan.
- TODO.md created with steps.
