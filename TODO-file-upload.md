# TODO: Implement File Upload CSS

## Overview
This TODO tracks the implementation of CSS styles for the file upload functionality to make it fully visible and interactive. The upload HTML and JS are already in place; we're adding styles to style.css.

## Steps

- [x] Step 1: Add CSS for upload area (#uploadArea) - Dashed border, centered content, dragover hover state, icon and hint text styling.
- [x] Step 2: Style file list (#fileList) - Grid or flex layout for multiple files, spacing between items.
- [x] Step 3: Style file items (.file-item) - Container for previews, info (name/size), and remove button; responsive for mobile.
- [x] Step 4: Style file previews (.file-preview for images, .file-icon for PDFs) - Image sizing, PDF icon with Lucide, consistent dimensions.
- [x] Step 5: Style upload button (#uploadBtn) and messages (.upload-message.success/error) - Consistent with site buttons, positioned feedback.
- [x] Step 6: Add animations (e.g., fade-in for messages, scale on dragover) and responsive media queries (stack layouts on mobile, adjust sizes).
- [ ] Step 7: Test the implementation - Relaunch browser, scroll to Get Involved, drag/drop files or click to upload, verify previews, remove, and simulate upload.
- [ ] Step 8: Update TODO-file-upload.md with completions and mark as done.
- [ ] Step 9: Use attempt_completion to finalize the task.
